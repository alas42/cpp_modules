Introduction to Templates

Awesome and Horrible

pieces of code to be filled, you can tell the compiler to fill it for you =>> new syntax.

1 - Parametric macros (C)

Introduction of a problematic solved by Templates
multiple fucntions that does the same but have different parameters
in C (max_int, max_float, max_char etc.) the prototype changes always but the code is the same
The Parametric Macros in define could have been used (#define max(x, y) ([...]))

The solution is not perfect
max(foo(x))
if the x has an edge effet, it will be reproduced two times, it is not related to the calculation.

2 - Templates

new syntax is template < typename T >
T const & max ( T const & x, T const & y){ return (x >= y ? x : y);}

3 - Default type
4 - specialization
